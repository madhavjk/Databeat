# Databeat-Task-2-Python
## TASK- DEVELOP A PYTHON PROGRAM TO DEMONSTRATE THE USE OF MICROSERVICES.

This project lets a user upvote or doenvote a trip location.

The project interconnects django and flask services using the "pika" module.

The Django service uses the port 8000 and the mysql associated with it uses the port 33066.
The Flask service uses the port 8001 and the mysql associated with it uses the port 33067. 

(The Trip_Recommender refers to the Django service and the Main refers to the Flask service)
